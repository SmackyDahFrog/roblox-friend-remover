# What is this?
- I made this program to automatically remove newly detected friends added on Roblox (from when the application was executed)
- This program is mainly for ACB, which will help clean up your friends list after a nuke.
- This program CAN be used without supplying your cookie, however you lose access to the automation features and can only get given a list of names to remove instead.
- This program MUST be already running with either your username or cookie supplied for it to work properly.

# Usage (With Cookies)
1. Install the latest release
2. Extract the file
3. Read "obtainCookies.txt" file for information on how to get your cookies
4. Put your cookies into cookies.txt, including the warning Roblox supplies
5. Before you start adding people in a nuke, open the program (it shouldn't give any cookie errors, if so retry getting cookie)
6. Leave the program running while you nuke, and after when you want to unadd people automatically select option 1
7. Follow the prompts and it'll do its magic!

# Usage (Without Cookies)
1. Install the latest release
2. Extract the file
5. Before you start adding people in a nuke, open the program and enter your Roblox username
6. Leave the program running while you nuke, and after when you want to unadd people select option 2
7. It'll print a list of names of users you need to unadd (using an extension from chrome etc. may help)
