I cannot stress this enough, DO NOT SHARE YOUR COOKhttps://github.com/SmackyDahFrog/roblox-friend-remover/tree/mainIE!
Even if you're asking for help or support, it is very important that you keep it to yourself
The code I made is all open source, there is no cookie stealers, the only safe spot to put it is in cookies.txt
ENSURE YOU ARE INSTALLING THE .EXE FILE FROM https://github.com/SmackyDahFrog/roblox-friend-remover

To Obtain Cookies:
1. Go to roblox.com
2. Right click anywhere and press "Inspect" 
3. Select Application at the top (if you can't see it, press the two arrows symbol for the dropdown menu)
4. Under "Storage", select "Cookies"
5. Under Name, select .ROBLOSECURITY
6. At the bottom, fully copy the Cookie Value
7. In the cookies.txt file, remove the text I had in there and fully paste in your cookie (INCLUDING THE WARNING!)
8. Launch the executable, should automatically know who you are


This will slightly vary from browser to browser, but most should be this method.
